I've been reading some books on writing, classics in the field, and I want to share a couple of ideas gleaned from the masters:<!--more-->

**Lawrence Block *Writing the Novel***

I’m implementing Block’s exercise of reducing stories to their basic plot. When reading a novel, jot down on the margins things that happen, just the events in broad strokes — the beats. Once done reading, write out these beats into an outline. This exercise, Block says, is a way of learning how novels work. By outlining the stories that you read, you master a technique that will be helpful when you’re writing your own story.

Another of Block’s advice is one I’m sure Dorothea Brande would agree with: keep a notebook where you write down ideas that pop into your head throughout the day and, that’s the important part, make a habit of glancing through the notebook before going to bed at night — that way your unconscious mind (or your genius, as Dorothea might say) can ruminate on these ideas and hopefully produce useful connections when you sit down to work.

**Robert McKee *Story***

This one is primarily intended for screenwriters but a lot of McKee’s advice will be useful to any and all story-tellers. One of the suggestions I’m keen to try out is to write backwards, from the Story Climax to the Inciting Incident.

I liked this idea because what often happens to me is that I come up with a great premise, and then I spend hours upon hours trying to decide what happens next and how it all ends. More often than not I get stuck and never find out. McKee suggest to look for great endings rather than intriguing beginnings. Once you have a vision of such a great ending, the Climax, try to figure out what has to have happened to lead to it in a meaningful and satisfying way.

Seems worth trying.
