Returning to the theme of positive-spirited entertainment, I’d like to recommend another book by Barbara Kingslover: *Pigs in Heaven*. It was a real pleasure to read a story about fundamentally decent people<!--more-->, even if the happy endings which they had coming were quite apparent early on. I found it rather comforting, and the book left me with this sentiment that, of course, life is not a novel, but really what is there to stop us all from behaving decently and enjoying our happy endings?

Kingslover has a knack for intimate stories that incorporate bigger themes, social, sometimes political issues. Some time ago I’ve written about my admiration for *The Lacuna*. *Pigs in Heaven* is Kingslover’s earlier novel, published in the early nineties. Thinking about it in retrospect, it strikes me as not as layered and complex as *The Lacuna*, nor as the book that Kingslover is best known for, *The Poisonwood Bible*. The social theme is rendered here with less subtlety and the narrative is not as strong either. Nonetheless, reading *Pigs in Heaven*, I was very much captivated and I enjoyed the ride from start to finish. I especially enjoyed how the protagonists had clashing agendas, but none of them were evil or even ruthless. Rather, they interpreted the good in different ways, and I sort of rooted for each and every one of them at same time. And the author made it worth my while giving them all a resolution.

By the way, only afterwards I discovered that *Pigs in Heaven* is a sequel to Kinglsover’s first novel, *The Bean Trees*. So if you want to meet the strong ladies of  the Greer family, you might want to start with this one. I still have to get around to it.
