Have you noticed the bumper crop of *The Girl…* books over the last years?

Back in 1999, when Tracy Chevalier published the [*Girl With a Pearl Earring*](http://amzn.to/2dzACxw) it was an original title.<!--more--> The trend started a decade later with Stieg Larsson’s Millenium Trilogy: [*The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*](http://amzn.to/2d6LPtu), [*The Girl Who Played with Fire*](http://amzn.to/2d9Pnrb), and [*The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest*](http://amzn.to/2dCXXRL).

After that *The Girl…* titles started to appear more often and across genres:

+ [*The Girl Who Never Made Mistakes*](http://amzn.to/2dzAFcP), a children's book by Mark Pett and Gary Rubinstein
+ [*The Girl Who Wrote in Silk*](http://amzn.to/2dkFWmU), a historical novel by Kelli Estes
+ [*The Girl with All the Gifts*](http://amzn.to/2drif1Q), a post-apocalyptic thriller by M. R. Carey
+ [*The Good Girl*](http://amzn.to/2drh5U3), a psychological thriller by Mary Kubica
+ [*The Girl He Never Noticed*](http://amzn.to/2drCHv0), a new-adult romance by sweetdreamer33 and Neilani Alejandrino
+ [*The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo*](http://amzn.to/2dzBOAS), a collection of satirical essays by Amy Schumer

It is, however, in thrillers that *The Girl…* truly triumphed, with bestsellers like [*The Girl on the Train*](http://amzn.to/2dkGvx7) by Paula Hawkins, [*Gone Girl*](http://amzn.to/2d6N8so) by Gillian Flynn, and [*Luckiest Girl Alive*](http://amzn.to/2drDmMP) by Jessica Knoll. The girl in question might be disturbed, she might have a lot of baggage and issues, but she’s a force to be reckoned with.

2016 confirms the trend. The following are all classified as thrillers of some sort:

+ [*The Girl in the Spider's Web*](http://amzn.to/2dzBMZS) by David Lagercrantz
+ [*The Perfect Girl*](http://amzn.to/2dkGFEI) by Gilly Macmillan
+ [*All the Missing Girls*](http://amzn.to/2dzBWjW) by Megan Miranda
+ [*My Girl*](http://amzn.to/2d9RdrY) by Jack Jordan
+ [*Girl in the Dark*](http://amzn.to/2d4notq) by Marion Pauw
+ [*Razor Girl*](http://amzn.to/2d6Oeo1) by Carl Hiaasen
+ and a more mature [*The Woman in Cabin 10*](http://amzn.to/2d9UjMm) by Ruth Ware

It’s good to see that authors are looking for some variations of *The Girl…* theme as the market becomes a little saturated. Try not to confuse the psychological thriller [*The Girl Before*](http://amzn.to/2d6O14j) by Rena Olsen with the suspense thriller [*The Girl Before*](http://amzn.to/2dkHkGb) by JP Delaney, scheduled for publication in 2017.
