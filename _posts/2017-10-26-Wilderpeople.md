It's the golden age of TV. Yes, yes, I agree. Some amazing shows out there lately, to be sure. But why do they all have to be so bloody dark?<!--more--> I know, authenticity, and taking risks storytelling, tackling big issues, I know. And I do like many of them too. But sometimes, just sometimes you're in a mood for something lighter. Not a stupid slapstick comedy, either. Just a funny, positive film that will make you feel better and maybe restore some faith in humanity.

You know that feeling?

Well, go and watch *Hunt for the Wilderpeople*. It's brilliant, it's upbeat, it's absurd, it's wholesome. If you'd like an elevator pitch for this movie, I'd say it's: *Moonrise Kingdom* in the New Zealand bush. Similar kind of absurd humor, wacky characters, and unforgettable scenes. I'm not exaggerating. Some of the lines from this movie made it into our reference lexicon, we quote them as in-jokes in relevant, and less so, situations and laugh again.

So if you've just seen another episode of *Black Mirror* and you're feeling like you want to slit your wrists â€” watch *Hunt for the Wilderpeople*. Maybe write a haiku, too. I hear they help expressing your feelings, dealing with issues.

Taika Waititi, *Hunt for the Wilderpeople*
